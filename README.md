# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

An independent, long-horizon architecture project focused on interoperable, autonomous cyber-physical infrastructure.

---

## What This Is

The **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)** is an open architectural framework for building autonomous, interoperable production systems — where computation, logistics, control, governance, and physical manufacturing collapse into a single coherent system.

UCPIS is not a product.  
It is not an application.  
It is a systems-level doctrine describing how future factories, robots, and industrial networks coordinate safely, transparently, and without vendor lock-in.

---

## Why It Exists

Modern industry is fragmented:

- Machines lack shared semantic and control primitives  
- Industrial control systems are brittle, opaque, and siloed  
- Automation scales faster than governance, safety, and accountability  

UCPIS exists to define **shared primitives** — technical, semantic, and organizational — so autonomous production can scale without becoming unsafe, ungovernable, or extractive.

---

## Active Work

Current focus areas include:

- Core UCPIS architecture and versioned specifications  
- Minimum Viable UCPIS-Executable (MVUE) definitions  
- Cyber-physical governance and safety envelopes  
- Open interfaces for robots, factories, and control systems  
- Design and aesthetic doctrine for cyber-physical environments  

This work is intentionally slow, foundational, and infrastructure-oriented.

## Key Repositories

- **UCPIS (Core)**  
  Foundational architecture, primitives, and normative doctrine  
  → https://github.com/ucpis2026us/ucpis

- **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack**  
  Visual language, signaling, and hazard communication for autonomous systems  
  → https://github.com/ucpis2026us/cyber-physical-aesthetic-stack

*(Additional repositories will be added as interfaces and specifications stabilize.)*

---

## Design Philosophy

- Systems > applications  
- Interoperability over optimization  
- Governance as an observable system property  
- Open primitives instead of proprietary stacks  
- Industrial autonomy without centralized control  

UCPIS treats factories, robots, and control software as **civic-scale infrastructure**, not merely private tools or products.

---

## Project Status

UCPIS is:

- Early-stage but conceptually mature  
- Publicly documented and actively evolving  
- Not seeking hype, tokens, or speculative funding  
- Designed for long-term relevance (10–30 year horizon)  

Contribution pathways may open later once core interfaces stabilize.

## Provenance

UCPIS is an independent cyber-physical architecture project initiated in 2026 by its inventor and current maintainer.

- **Inventor:** Michael James Malecek  
- **Year:** 2026  
- **Location:** Delano, Minnesota, United States

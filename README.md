# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

Public architecture and doctrine for interoperable, autonomous cyber-physical infrastructure.

I design long-horizon systems describing how computation, machines, operators, and governance coordinate when infrastructure becomes programmable.

UCPIS is the primary vehicle for this work.

## About UCPIS

UCPIS defines shared primitives for:

- robotics  
- manufacturing  
- logistics  
- control  
- safety  
- authority  
- observability  

It is not a company, product, or platform.

It is systems doctrine for constructing industrial capability that remains legible, governable, and interoperable across vendors, jurisdictions, and generations.

---

## Why It Exists

Modern industrial systems are fragmented.

- Interfaces are proprietary  
- Machines lack shared semantics  
- Integration cost slows deployment  
- Governance and auditability lag automation  

Without common primitives, autonomy scales faster than coordination.

UCPIS exists to provide a stable foundation for cooperation across organizations and technologies.

Additional repositories will appear as abstractions stabilize.

---

## Design Orientation

- Infrastructure over applications  
- Durable primitives  
- Clarity before scale  
- Independence from hype cycles  
- Systems that must outlive their creators  

---

## Maturity

Early in build.  
Advanced in direction.

## For Observers

Those working in robotics, industrial automation, logistics, public infrastructure, or machine governance are seeing early groundwork.

Follow the repositories as the abstractions solidify.

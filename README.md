# Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)

**Inventor & systems architect building long-horizon cyber-physical infrastructure.**  
Focused on autonomous production, industrial interoperability, and post-software system design.

## What This Is

The **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)** is an open architectural framework for building autonomous, interoperable production systems — where computation, logistics, control, governance, and physical manufacturing collapse into a single coherent system.

UCPIS is not a product.  
It is not an app.  
It is a systems-level doctrine for how future factories, robots, and industrial networks coordinate safely, transparently, and without vendor lock-in.

---

## Why It Exists

Modern industry is fragmented:
- Machines don’t speak a common language  
- Control systems are brittle and opaque  
- Automation scales faster than governance  

UCPIS exists to define **shared primitives** — technical, semantic, and organizational — so autonomous production can scale without becoming unsafe, ungovernable, or extractive.

---

## Active Work

Current focus areas include:
- Core UCPIS architecture and versioned specifications
- Minimum Viable UCPIS-Executable (MVUE)
- Cyber-physical governance and safety envelopes
- Open interfaces for robots, factories, and control systems
- Design and aesthetic doctrine for cyber-physical systems

This work is intentionally slow, foundational, and infrastructure-oriented.

## Key Repositories

- **UCPIS (Core)**  
  Foundational architecture, primitives, and doctrine  
  → https://github.com/ucpis2026us/ucpis

- **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack**  
  Visual language, signaling, and hazard communication for autonomous systems  
  → https://github.com/ucpis2026us/cyber-physical-aesthetic-stack

*(More repositories will be added as specifications stabilize.)*

---

## Design Philosophy

- Systems > applications  
- Interoperability over optimization  
- Governance as an observable system property  
- Open primitives instead of proprietary stacks  
- Industrial autonomy without central control  

UCPIS treats factories, robots, and control software as **civic-scale infrastructure**, not just private tools.

---

## Project Status

UCPIS is:
- Early-stage but conceptually mature
- Publicly documented and evolving
- Not seeking hype, tokens, or speculative funding
- Designed for long-term relevance (10–30 year horizon)

Contributions may open later once interfaces stabilize.
